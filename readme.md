Welcome, my fellow Windesheim student. :mage: <br/>
My guess is that you found this repository by searching for "Racesimulator" on this very website. <br/>
Well, you're in luck, you found a racesimulator assignment from another student, congratulations. <br/>

As with all the other public Racesimulator assignments, nothing is stopping you from using it to your heart's content.<br/>
Just keep in mind; you shouldn't blatantly copy everything. As one of the requirements is to be able to explain your code, which you'll have to do more as you progress in the study.
And let me tell you, I can't even explain half of this mess.

Your best option is to, _wait for it_, make the assignment yourself! <br/>
And use the availible repositories as a way to see how other students tackled certain problems. Beacuse lord knows the lessons explain jack shit about the assignment.

Anyway, I ain't your mum. If you want to copy all the work, go ahead, your bad grade isn't my problem.

As to why the repository is called "Reparatiesimulator" well, this isn't my first time making this assignment. #TeamReparatieSemester
